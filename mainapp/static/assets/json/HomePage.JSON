With a solid foundation in programming and software development skills acquired through my education, I have gained experience writing a diverse range of scripts and classes. From managing collisions in a video game to automating tasks by renaming every file in a folder, I have tackled a variety of challenges. Even in my professional roles in IT and Technical Support, I leveraged my programming knowledge to create functional web pages and automate workflows. I am confident that the following projects I have worked on showcase the depth and variety of my programming expertise.",
