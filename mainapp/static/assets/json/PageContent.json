The snake is made up of consecutive letter o's and is controlled by pressing WASD keys or the arrow keys. Numbers from 1-9 will appear on screen in random locations. When the head of the snake collides with the number, the snake grows by that number of o's. The player wins the game when the snake is as long as half the length of the perimeter of the console window. If the snake collides with itself or the walls of the perimeter, the game ends in a loss.",
